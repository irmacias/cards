Hello there! My name is Israel Macias and I am a fourth year undergraduate student studying Computer Science at MIT. I've many interests,
specifically in Software Development and working with Data. My previous experience is as a Data Scientist Intuit at Facebook and as a Software Engineering Intern at Intuit. Currently I am working on research with MIT's Urban Risk Lab to develop a crowdsourced
emergency response platform.

Feel free to contact me about any of my projects and past internships/research, and I'd love to talk more!

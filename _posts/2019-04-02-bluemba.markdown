Here I present my team's final project for MIT's 6.s062: Mobile Sensors and Computing, Bluemba.

The purpose of this project is to enhance a Roomba's capability of cleaning without the need of more expensive hardware. This is done primarily through the usage of Bluetooth Low-Energy sensors to be able to guide a Roomba through a planned path to minimize time. See the powerpoint below:
